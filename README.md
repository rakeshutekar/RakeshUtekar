<!--INTRODUCTION-->
<h1 align="center"> Hi there, I'm Rakesh.  </h1>

Hello, my name is <b>Rakesh</b>, a `Computer Science` graduate student at Seattle University, `specializing in Data Science`. What drives me is the desire to leverage technology to make people's lives easier, especially for those with disabilities.

As a `Machine Learning Engineer` at SlashRTC Software Services Pvt. Ltd., I've developed innovative solutions that have made a real impact. My work on advanced speech-to-text models and chatbots has significantly improved customer satisfaction and accessibility.

One of my most impactful projects is the `Real-Time Sign Language to Speech Translation` system. By leveraging the I3D model and fine-tuning it on the WLASL dataset, I've created a solution that bridges the communication gap for individuals with hearing impairments. This project has the potential to greatly enhance their daily interactions and overall quality of life.

Additionally, I've developed a cutting-edge `Real-Time Speech to Speech Translation` system that enables seamless communication across different languages. By incorporating state-of-the-art models like Whisper and OpenAI TTS, I've created a solution that breaks down language barriers and facilitates global understanding.

My proficiency in Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, combined with my deep commitment to creating meaningful solutions, allows me to drive innovation in the field of assistive technologies.

As I pursue my master's degree with an expected graduation in `2024`, I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to projects that can make a difference in people's lives. I genuinely believe that my passion for helping others and expertise in AI would make me a valuable asset to any team!

Thank you for your consideration!
